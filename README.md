# Credit-card-Fraud-detection



# 📌 Description
This project is a machine learning-based solution for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. It uses a real-world dataset and explores various techniques including data preprocessing, feature selection, handling imbalanced data, and model evaluation. The notebook demonstrates how machine learning can be leveraged to improve security and prevent financial fraud.

# 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is highly imbalanced and contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. It includes features obtained through PCA to maintain confidentiality.




# 🔧 Requirements

Python 3.7+
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
imbalanced-learn
xgboost



# 📈 Results

The models were evaluated using various metrics with Random Forest and XGBoost performing the best in terms of accuracy and recall on the imbalanced data.
